<p>Unicode is a computing industry standard for the consistent encoding,representation and handling of text expressed in most of the world's writing system . Developed in conjuction with the Universal Character Set standard and published in the form as The Unicode Standard. The Standard consists of a set of code charts for visual reference, an encoding method set of standard character encodings, a set of reference data computer files, and a number of related items.</p>
<h3>Mapping and Encodings  </h3>
<p>Unicode defines two mapping methods: the Unicode Transformation Format (UTF) encodings, and the Universal Character Set (UCS) encodings. An encoding maps (possibly a subset of) the range of Unicode code points to sequences of values in some fixed-size range, termed code values. The numbers in the names of the encodings indicate the number of bits in one code value (for UTF encodings) or the number of bytes per code value (for UCS) encodings. UTF-8 and UTF-16 are probably the most commonly used encodings. UCS-2 is an obsolete subset of UTF-16; UCS-4 and UTF-32 are functionally equivalent.

UTF encodings include:
<ul>
   <li> UTF-1 – a retired predecessor of UTF-8, maximizes compatibility with ISO 2022, no longer part of The Unicode Standard</li>
   <li> UTF-7 – a 7-bit encoding sometimes used in e-mail, often considered obsolete (not part of The Unicode Standard, but only documented as an informational 
RFC, i.e. not on the Internet Standards Track either)</li>
    <li>UTF-8 – an 8-bit variable-width encoding which maximizes compatibility with ASCII.</li>
    <li>UTF-EBCDIC – an 8-bit variable-width encoding similar to UTF-8, but designed for compatibility with EBCDIC. (not part of The Unicode Standard)</li>
<li>UTF-16 – a 16-bit, variable-width encoding</li>
<li>UTF-32 – a 32-bit, fixed-width encoding</li>
</ul>
</p>
